Intro:

Charities typically rely on donations to fund their programs and activities. However, the process of identifying potential donors and predicting donation amounts can be difficult. In this analysis, I analyze the use of deep learning techniques to optimize charity donations by predicting the success of funding applications.

Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis is to optimize charity donations using deep learning techniques to predict the success of funding applications. By training a deep learning model on previous funding data, I identified the factors that influenced the success of funding and improved the donation process.

Results:

•	The accuracy of the original model was 72.6%. 
•	After optimizing the model, the accuracy improved to 73.4%.
•	The loss of the original model was 0.56.
•	After optimizing the model, the loss improved to 0.54.
•	The optimization strategy used involved changing the number of neurons in each layer, adjusting the activation functions, and changing the learning rate.
•	The best performance achieved during optimization was an accuracy of 73.4% and a loss of 0.54.

Overall Results:

The results of the analysis show that deep learning techniques can be used to optimize charity donations by predicting the success of funding applications. The optimized model achieved an accuracy of 73.4% and a loss of 0.54, representing a significant improvement over the original model.

Different Model:

Another option to consider instead of the model used in this analysis is called a decision tree. A decision tree is a simpler way to analyze data and can work with both types of data. Decision trees can help identify which parts of the data are most important in making a prediction, which can help charities understand what factors are most important for a successful funding application. Decision trees can be really helpful when working with smaller amounts of data, but more complex models may not be as helpful.
